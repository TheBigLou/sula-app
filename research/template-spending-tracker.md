## Spending Visibility & Look-Back Experience

*How good is the core transaction-browsing experience? Can you easily see what you spent last month on restaurants? Across multiple accounts? Does it require setup first (budgets, categories) before showing you useful data, or does it give you insight immediately?*

---

## Household / Multi-User Support

*Can multiple people connect their accounts? How does it handle separate logins, permissions, and labeling of whose account is whose? Is this a first-class feature or bolted on?*

---

## AI & Intelligence Features

*This is a critical section. Assess each dimension honestly — "none", "basic", or describe what exists.*

**Transaction categorization**
How does it categorize transactions — rule-based, ML, or AI? How accurate, especially for ambiguous or cryptic merchant names? Does it enrich merchant data (clean names, logos)? Does it learn from corrections?

**Natural language interface**
Can you query your data conversationally (e.g., "what did we spend on groceries in January")? Is there a chat or assistant interface? How capable is it — genuinely useful or superficial?

**AI-generated insights**
Does it proactively surface spending patterns, anomalies, or month-over-month changes in natural language? Or is reporting limited to static charts and dashboards?

**Perks / transaction intelligence**
Any AI-driven connection between transactions and card benefits (e.g., auto-detecting that a statement credit was used)?

**Overall AI maturity**
*One sentence verdict: is AI a core part of the product or a bolted-on feature?*

---

## Card Perks / Credits Tracking

*Does this app track credit card statement credits or benefits at all? If so, how — automated via transactions or manual? Which issuers/cards are supported?*

---

## Account & Bank Connectivity

*How reliable is the connection to major banks and card issuers? What do users report about Amex, Chase, BofA, etc.? Any known connectivity issues?*

---

## Business Model & Pricing

*Free tier scope, paid tier cost and what's unlocked, any ads or data monetization.*
