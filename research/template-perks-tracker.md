## Positioning & Core Value Prop

*One paragraph. What does this app say it is? Who is it for? What's the headline promise?*

---

## Cards & Issuers Supported

*Which card networks and issuers are supported? Is it limited to specific cards (e.g., only Amex and Chase premium cards) or broad? How many cards does it know about?*

---

## Perks & Credits Tracking

*What types of card benefits does it track? Cover the following dimensions:*

- **Statement credits** (e.g., airline fee credit, hotel credit, dining credit): tracked automatically via transactions, or manual check-off?
- **Recurring credits** (monthly/quarterly/annual reset): does it reset tracking automatically?
- **Rotating bonus categories** (e.g., Chase Freedom quarterly 5%): does it track and remind?
- **Limited-time offers** (Amex Offers, Chase Offers): auto-activated or surfaced?
- **Non-credit perks** (lounge access, hotel status, travel protections): tracked at all?

---

## Transaction Connectivity

*Does the app connect to your actual account/transactions to auto-detect when a credit has been used? If so, what connectivity method (Plaid, screen scraping, read-only API)? Or is it entirely manual/self-reported?*

---

## AI & Intelligence Features

*Perks trackers have a specific AI opportunity: matching transactions to benefits automatically. Assess each dimension.*

**Automated perk detection**
Can it look at your actual transactions and determine that a specific credit or benefit was used — without you manually checking it off? How does it do this (transaction matching rules, ML, LLM)? How reliable?

**Merchant / transaction intelligence**
Does it recognize that a Resy-booked restaurant charge = Amex Platinum Resy credit used? Or that a $15 Dunkin charge used the Amex Gold monthly dining credit? Assess the sophistication of the matching logic.

**Natural language or conversational interface**
Any ability to ask questions about your benefits status or spending naturally?

**Proactive recommendations**
Does it suggest which card to use for a given purchase based on your current perk status (e.g., "use Amex Gold here — you haven't used your dining credit this month")?

**Overall AI maturity**
*One sentence verdict: is AI meaningfully used, or is this a rules-based system dressed up as smart?*

---

## Notification & Reminder System

*How does the app remind users to use benefits before they expire? Push notifications, in-app alerts, email? How configurable is this?*

---

## Household / Multi-User Support

*Can this be used for multiple cardholders (e.g., a couple with different cards)? How are multiple people's cards managed — shared profile, separate logins, or not supported?*

---

## Business Model & Pricing

*Free tier scope, paid tier cost and what's unlocked.*

---
